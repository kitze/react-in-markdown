# react-in-markdown
v0.0.1 🎉 - by [@thekitze](http://kitze.io)

> ⚠️ Warning: This is not a standalone library, it should be used along with the [markdown-to-react-components](https://github.com/christianalfoni/markdown-to-react-components) library

### What does it do?

This library allows you to render custom React Components when writing Markdown, using a special syntax.

```[emoji](code=fire, size=35)```

This will render the ```emoji``` component, with ```{code:'fire', size:'35'}``` as props.


### How does rendering Markdown to React work?

In order to render Markdown to React components you should use the [markdown-to-react-components](https://github.com/christianalfoni/markdown-to-react-components) library. Under the hood it's really simple, it uses [marked](https://github.com/chjj/marked) to parse a string that contains Markdown, and it returns back React components.

The cool thing about the MTRC library is the ```configure``` method which can customize the output of the components. An example:

```js
import MTRC from 'markdown-to-react-components';

MTRC.configure({
  h1: React.createClass({
    render() {
      return <h1 id={this.props.id} style={{color: 'red'}}>{this.props.children}</h1>
    }
  })
});
```

### How to use react-in-markdown

In order to render custom React components inside of Markdown, you should plug the ```renderCustomComponents``` method into the configuration of the **```a```** element:

```js
import MTRC from 'markdown-to-react-components';
import {renderCustomComponents} from 'react-in-markdown';

const customComponents = {
	emoji: ({code,size}) => <div style={{fontSize:size}}> {code} </div>,
	awesomeHeader: ({size=22, children}) => <h1> style={{fontSize:size}}>children </h1>
};

MTRC.configure({
  a: props => renderCustomComponents(props, customComponents)
});
```

So when the parser finds the anchor syntax ```[emoji](code=fire,size=35)``` it will try to check if ```emoji``` is a key in our ```customComponents``` object. In this case, ```emoji``` is a key in our ```customComponents``` object, so it will render that component with the props.

But if we have a regular link like ```[Kitze.io](http://kitze.io)```, it will see that ```Kitze.io``` isn't a key in the ```customComponents``` object so it will just render a regular link 👉 [Kitze.io](http://kitze.io)

### ToDo

- Eval props after parsing them so we can use integers, booleans, arrays, and objects as props
